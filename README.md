# Hi Guys, Welcome to this cool project

I hope to create a community where it is convenient for everyone to exchange their experiences in the learning of data structures and algorithms, and to record the learning process. Through learning, hope everyone will pass the 2022 spring semester course with excellent grades.

This project aims to motivate everybody who wants to improve their data structure and algorithms skill.

If you read this file, means you probably already take part in this project or organisation, so here are some guide for you guys to make this organisation run healthy and secure.

The most important thing that create a branch for yourself. After clone this repository, please switch branch to your own branch and do not change other's branch.
```shell
# you can use this command to switch branch
git switch -c <branch name>
```

The second thing is I hope this is a peaceful, opensource and vibrant community. If anyone has any problem about technology or course, please feel free to ask via raise a new Issue. If you have any idea on issues raised by others, please feel free to leave your understanding under the issue

In the end, Thanks for the sincere cooperation and your contributions to this community.
